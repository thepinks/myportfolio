								<h2>My Education</h2>
								<p>My name is Camille Hall. I am currently in Web Design and Development with Interaction and Design Emphasis.
									 I started my journey at Utah Valley University thinking I would want to do computer science because I
									  was invested in it and then I came to realize the computer science program was not what I wanted to do for 
									  the rest of my life. Luckily, I was able to comprehend that I wanted to do design rather than coding. I 
									  started pursuing a degree in web development and app emphasis, but then I recently switched to interaction
									   and design. That decision was perfect for me because I enjoy designing and re-designing websites, and 
									   how I was able to learn and make beautiful and responsive websites.</p>

								<p>My present education goals here at UVU are to learn and proceed into creating useful yet productive websites. 
									I genuinely appreciate how UVU provides amazing tools for students to enroll and explore the world of digital media. 
									I would love to learn more of the programming languages when creating websites. I know this career is a continuous process 
									of gaining knowledge and skills and it will continue to grow especially with technology. I will take what I have learned 
									from the past few years attending this school and will be able to apply it to my future work. My long-term career is to 
									become a freelance web designer. To my knowledge, there is always good and bad in this field and I must prepare myself for 
									the outcome. For it's worth, I cherish success as having the chance to do what I want and be passionate at the same time and
									 share with my clients. </p>

								<h2>Interactive Kiosk Development</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/kiosk.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In my previous class, we were taught how to create an Attraction Loop using Kinetic Typography. Us students used music, text, or 
									lyrics to create a 30-second animation that leverages typography while learning Hype 4.0 Professional's basic features. On top 
									of that, I was able to build knowledge on using keyframes, scenes, and timelines when creating an Interactive Infographic. 
									The project had many adjustments and arrangements. With this style guide, I was able to follow the order and learn from my mistakes.

								<h2>Prototype</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/prototype-zion.png" alt="" /></span>


								<p>Creating interactive prototypes in Adobe XD allowed me to rapidly and visually changes and designs projects. 
									It is very easy to use especially it interfaces with Photoshop and Illustrator. I enjoy doing prototypes especially 
									on Adobe XD because it's simple and focused. It makes the design for websites or apps effortlessly move to create various links,
									 buttons, animations, etc.

								<h2>Mood Board</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/bp_.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>A mood board used on which samples of various colors and textures are put together to help in deciding which elements complement each other. 
									It's a way of including anything that helps a designer to define the direction of my project.

								<p>A few semesters ago, I took a certain class that allowed students to show their skills on redesigning the school's Culinary website.
